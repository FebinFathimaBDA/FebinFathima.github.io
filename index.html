    <h1>Big Data</h1>

    <!-- Definition -->
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Definition:</strong><br> Big Data is a collection of diverse, complex and reliable data, yet to grow exponentialy by time in hypervelocity which are impossible to process using traditional data management tools and methods. It performs analysis, processing and storage of reliable data including both structured and unstructured data at real-time from heterogenous sources. These processed data is visualized to learn trends and patterns and helps organizations in better decision making, improved customer satisfaction and improved efficiency in operations.</p>

    <h2>Key Properties of Big Data "4 Vs"</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">
Variety, Velocity , Volume & Veracity are the key properties of Big Data. A massive volume of data can be collected and processed using big data processing tools compared to traditional data analysis tools. Variety means different types of data being generated including structured like texts or databases and unstructured like videos, images, xml files etc. The term velocity refers the speed at which data is continuously stored, analysed, and processed at real-time. The last V, Veracity refers to clean and reliable data which is very important for decision making.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">
Big Data analytics methods includes Real-Time analytics, Distibuted computing using tools like Hadoop & spark,predictive analytics which uses machine learning algorithms to predict future trends, NoSQL databases which can store unstructured datas, Machine vision and Natural Language Processing methods.

<h2>Version 3, An Introduction to Data Science</br>
Author: Jeffrey Stanton, Syracuse University</h2>
(With A Contribution by Robert W. De Graaf)
<h4>An Introduction to Data Science</h4>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">
This book starts with an introduction and slowly explains statistics and machine learning. He explains real world problems with data visualization and calculations. Also, R is introduced in this book. In my opinion it’s a good start for beginners and makes them eager to dive into the field of data science. Most importantly it’s a free source of learning.
